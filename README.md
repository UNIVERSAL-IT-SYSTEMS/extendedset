CONCISE (COmpressed 'N' Composable Integer SEt) library
=======================================================

This library was written by [Alessandro Colantonio](http://ricerca.mat.uniroma3.it/users/colanton/concise.html).

Rationale
---------

This repository is a mere attempt to keep sources with necessary patches (in our case,
`Serializable` `ConciseSet`) intact and available. As a side effect, several changes
to the syntax were made (see e.g.,
[capture#XXX in error message (Java Generics)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7957374/capturexxx-in-error-message-java-generics))
in order to make code compilable on Apple's JDK 1.6.0.

Additionally, a maven project was created and artifacts (`extendedset:extendedset`) were deployed
to the [EBI repository](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/maven/nexus/content/repositories/ebi-repo).
